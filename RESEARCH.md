# Infinity Vector Bitcoin → Octave Research

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-16 22:13:43 UTC  

## System Description
This node operates as a *Bitcoin intelligence forge*, not a false mining claim.
It maps deterministic hashrate ratios into **Octave space**, producing a
continuous vector suitable for symbolic, economic, and frequency-based analysis.

## Parameters
- Local Hashrate: 50000000 H/s
- Network Hashrate: 600000000000000000000 H/s
- Block Reward: 3.125 BTC
- BTC Price (est.): $43000

## Live Output
- BTC / day: 3.75e-11
- USD / day: 1.6125e-06
- Octave Vector: 5.6439

## Interpretation
The octave value represents a logarithmic compression of work-per-second,
allowing Bitcoin difficulty to be expressed as a harmonic frequency instead
of a raw power metric.

This enables:
- Vectorized economic modeling
- Cross-domain resonance mapping
- Symbolic ledger anchoring without false energy claims
